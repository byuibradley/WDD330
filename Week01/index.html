    <h2>Week 01</h2>
    <ul>
       
        <li>The Syllabus was easy and understood.</li>
        <li>Started the first week and read through many of the articles.</li>
        <li>Most items were refreshers and did not make sense to go through exercises.&nbsp; Sure the next weeks will be much harder and will need more input.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Something else that stood out was start small and work from mobile to desktop.&nbsp; I found this funny because in the last WDD class I took, they wanted us to start large and work down to the pages with mobile, saving the mobile pages with the hamburger menu as least important.&nbsp; Times have changed.</li>
        <li>Also found it interesting on where placement of the mobile menu or hamburger is critical.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>When you first learn to create a website, the page loading information is so key, but as everything mobiles to smaller screens and mobile, big and beautiful with flash becomes not friendly and fast and the UE is everything.</li>
    </ul>
