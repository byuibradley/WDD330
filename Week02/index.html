    <h2>Week 02</h2>
    <p>Notes</p>

<ul>
	<li>Let and Var are no longer needed after ES6&nbsp; (Thank goodness)</li>
	<li>dot notation is better than brackets, but in some cases brackets are good.
	<ul>
		<li>.length - great field.&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<ul>
			<li>If value needs to only be a certain length, constrict length with this, such as medicine.length = 20;&nbsp;
			<ul>
				<li>Allow for medicine names to only be 20 characters max.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Ternary Operators are game changers.&nbsp; Shorten code with if/then with a ?</li>
	<li>Looping with Arrays, try to remember size - size matters for program processing.</li>
	<li>**IMPORTANT BRADLEY: Do not confuse JavaScript with SQL PLSQL loops**</li>
	<li>Love the term DRY, Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself! - Chapter 4</li>
	<li>Remember to round your results on returns of functions when the calculation would yield multiple decimal places, depending on how accurate the result needs to be.</li>
	<li>For Each and For (Let...) can be used viced versa with For Each used in leui of loop.</li>
</ul>

<p>Practice</p>

<ul>
	<li>See Quiz Ninja Example on Hero Real Names</li>
	<li>NOTE: If time permits in the week,&nbsp; try to create script that counts words and then ranks them by count. - Time unavailable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Why return a -1 when a character does not appear in a string when using indexof?&nbsp; I would think a 0 or a NULL would be a better option.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Why would we use a bitwise?&nbsp; What are some applications that a bitwise would be useful?</li>
</ol>
