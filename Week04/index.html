    <p>Notes</p>

    <ul>
      <li>HTML FORM RESET is a bad practice.
      <ul>
        <li>Perhaps a JS button that asks, &quot;Are you sure you want to reset your form?&quot;</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Practice</p>
    
    <p>None - Very familiar with objects and forms in JS.</p>
    
    <p>None - only with Group</p>
    
    <p>Questions:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>If RESET is a horrible experience, why not reload the page; or is that just as bad as using a RESET.&nbsp; My mindset just suggests that using JavaScript to clear the entries would require a lot of code depending on the complexity or length of a form.</li>
    </ol>
